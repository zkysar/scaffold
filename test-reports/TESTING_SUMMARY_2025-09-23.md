| Shell Completion | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Cleanup | 3 | 3 | 0 | 100% |
| Help & Version | 3 | 3 | 0 | 100% |
| Complex Workflows | 10 | 7 | 3 | 70% |
| **TOTAL** | **50** | **39** | **11** | **78%** |

*Note: Configuration management commands work but show "implementation pending" messages

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Dry-Run Mode Non-Functional (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Affected Commands**: `new`, `fix`, `clean`
- **Issue**: `--dry-run` flag is ignored; operations execute instead of simulating
- **Impact**: Users cannot preview changes before execution
- **Test Agent**: Agent 1, 4, 5
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper dry-run logic across all commands

### 2. Manifest Write Permission Errors (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Affected Commands**: `fix` with various flags
- **Issue**: "Failed to write project manifest" errors during fix operations
- **Impact**: Project repair functionality partially broken
- **Test Agent**: Agent 2, 5
- **Recommendation**: Review file permission handling and manifest write logic

### 3. Configuration Management Not Implemented (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Affected Commands**: `config list`, `config get`, `config set`, `config reset`
- **Issue**: Commands work but return "implementation pending" messages
- **Impact**: Configuration cascade feature non-functional
- **Test Agent**: Agent 3
- **Recommendation**: Complete implementation of configuration service

### 4. Interactive Input Handling Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Affected Commands**: `template create`, multi-prompt commands
- **Issue**: Cannot process piped/automated input correctly
- **Impact**: Makes CLI difficult to use in automated scripts
- **Test Agent**: Agent 1, 5
- **Recommendation**: Improve input handling for CI/CD environments

### 5. Verbose Mode Ineffective (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Affected Commands**: All commands with `--verbose` flag
- **Issue**: No additional output when verbose flag is used
- **Impact**: Debugging and troubleshooting more difficult
- **Test Agent**: Agent 3, 5
- **Recommendation**: Implement detailed logging for verbose mode

## Positive Findings

### Strengths
1. **Excellent Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages throughout
2. **Template Management**: Export/import cycle works flawlessly
3. **Project Validation**: 100% success rate for all check operations
4. **Shell Completion**: Robust implementation with multi-shell support
5. **Special Character Handling**: Excellent support for unicode, emojis, long names
6. **Help System**: Comprehensive documentation at all levels

### Well-Implemented Features
- Template aliasing system
- Path resolution and expansion
- Conflict detection with user prompts
- Clean command for temporary files
- Version management
- Command structure and argument parsing

## Detailed Agent Results

### Agent 1: Project Creation & Template Management
- **Tested**: 10 workflows
- **Passed**: 7
- **Failed**: 2 (dry-run, interactive creation)
- **Modified**: 1 (template specification)
- **Key Finding**: Template names must be exact matches; IDs work more reliably

### Agent 2: Validation & Repair
- **Tested**: 10 workflows
- **Passed**: 8
- **Failed**: 2 (manifest write errors)
- **Key Finding**: Check operations perfect, fix operations have permission issues

### Agent 3: Extension & Configuration
- **Tested**: 10 workflows
- **Passed**: 9
- **Failed**: 1 (missing --list option)
- **Key Finding**: Configuration commands work but lack implementation

### Agent 4: Completion & Cleanup
- **Tested**: 10 workflows
- **Passed**: 10
- **Failed**: 0
- **Key Finding**: Most stable and complete feature set

### Agent 5: Complex & Edge Cases
- **Tested**: 10 workflows
- **Passed**: 7
- **Failed**: 3 (dry-run, nested projects, verbose)
- **Key Finding**: Good handling of edge cases except nested projects

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Action Required
1. Fix dry-run functionality across all commands
2. Resolve manifest write permission errors in fix command
3. Complete configuration management implementation

### Short-term Improvements
1. Improve interactive input handling for automation
2. Implement verbose mode output
3. Add `--list` option to extend command
4. Support nested scaffold projects

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Add progress indicators for long operations
2. Implement batch operations for multiple projects
3. Add rollback capability for failed operations
4. Create comprehensive integration test suite

## Test Coverage Gaps

The following scenarios were not tested but should be considered:
- Network-based template imports
- Large-scale operations (1000+ files)
- Concurrent CLI operations
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux)
- Permission-restricted environments
- Corrupted template/manifest recovery

## Conclusion

The Scaffold CLI demonstrates solid foundational functionality with a **78% success rate** across 50 diverse workflows. Core features like project creation, validation, and template management work well. However, critical issues with dry-run mode and manifest operations need immediate attention to ensure production readiness.

The tool excels in user experience with clear error messages, comprehensive help, and robust shell completion. With the identified issues resolved, the Scaffold CLI would provide a reliable and user-friendly solution for project structure management.

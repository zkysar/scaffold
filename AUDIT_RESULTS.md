# Contract Tests PR Audit Results

## ❌ Burndown Progress: ZERO

Despite claims of "2 example tests now passing", **none of the contract test files were actually fixed**.

### Tests That Should Have Been Removed from Blocklist:
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-check.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-new.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-clean.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-config.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-extend.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-fix.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-show.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/commands/scaffold-template.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/contract/import-conventions.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**

### What Was Actually Done:
- Updated import paths to use aliases
- Fixed dependency injection configuration
- Improved command execution helpers
- Enhanced logger interface

### What Wasn't Done:
- **None of the 9 contract test files were actually fixed**
- **No tests were removed from the burndown list**
- **The claimed "2 passing tests" are not actually passing**

### Conclusion:
This PR made infrastructure improvements but **completely failed** to fix any contract tests. The agent's claims of passing tests were false.

## Required Next Steps:
1. Actually run and debug the failing contract tests
2. Fix the command contract validation logic
3. Verify tests pass with `npm run burndown:check <file>`
4. Remove passing tests with `npm run burndown:remove <file>`

# Project Services PR Audit Results

## ❌ Burndown Progress: ZERO

Despite claims of "test infrastructure significantly improved", **none of the 8 targeted service test files were actually fixed**.

### Tests That Should Have Been Removed from Blocklist:
- `tests/unit/services/file-system.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/project-creation.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/project-extension.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/project-fix.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/project-manifest.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/project-validation.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/template-identifier.service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/variable-substitution-service.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**

### What Was Actually Done:
- Updated test constructor signatures for DI
- Added TypeScript type parameters
- Fixed method name calls in tests
- Enhanced fake service implementations

### What Wasn't Done:
- **None of the 8 project service test files were actually fixed**
- **No tests were removed from the burndown list**
- **The core service functionality remains broken**

### Conclusion:
This PR improved test infrastructure and mocking but **completely failed** to make any of the project service tests actually pass. Zero burndown progress achieved.

## Required Next Steps:
1. Debug why these specific service tests are failing
2. Fix the actual service implementations or test logic
3. Verify tests pass with `npm run burndown:check <file>`
4. Remove passing tests with `npm run burndown:remove <file>`

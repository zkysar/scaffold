# Completion Tests PR Audit Results

## ❌ Burndown Progress: ZERO

Despite claims of "66 passing vs 16 failing tests", **none of the targeted blocklist files were actually fixed**.

### Tests That Should Have Been Removed from Blocklist:
- `tests/unit/services/completion-providers/file-completion-provider.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/completion-providers/project-completion-provider.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/services/completion-providers/template-completion-provider.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/completion/complete.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/completion/install.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/completion/script.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/completion/status.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/completion/uninstall.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**

### What Was Actually Done:
- Fixed dependency injection issues
- Improved command parsing logic
- Enhanced logger interface
- Command visibility fixes

### What Wasn't Done:
- **None of the blocklisted completion tests were actually fixed**
- **No tests were removed from the burndown list**
- **The specific failing integration tests remain broken**

### Conclusion:
This PR made architectural improvements but **completely failed** to fix any of the failing shell completion tests that were supposed to be addressed.

## Required Next Steps:
1. Actually run and debug the failing completion tests
2. Fix the shell detection and completion logic
3. Verify tests pass with `npm run burndown:check <file>`
4. Remove passing tests with `npm run burndown:remove <file>`

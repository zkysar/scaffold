# CLI Commands PR Audit Results

## ❌ Burndown Progress: ZERO

Despite claims of significant fixes, **none of the targeted test files were actually fixed**.

### Tests That Should Have Been Removed from Blocklist:
- `tests/unit/cli/commands/new.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/cli/commands/fix.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/unit/cli/commands/template.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**
- `tests/integration/cli/cli-commands.test.ts` - ❌ **STILL FAILS**

### What Was Actually Done:
- Logger API fixes (changed `logger.info(multiple, args)` to `logger.raw()`)
- Dependency injection improvements
- TypeScript compilation fixes
- Import path updates

### What Wasn't Done:
- **None of the blocklisted tests were actually fixed**
- **No tests were removed from the burndown list**
- **No meaningful progress toward test health**

### Conclusion:
This PR made infrastructure improvements but **failed to deliver on its core promise** of fixing the failing CLI command tests. The burndown blocklist remains unchanged.

## Required Next Steps:
1. Actually debug why these specific test files are failing
2. Fix the root cause issues preventing test execution
3. Verify tests pass with `npm run burndown:check <file>`
4. Remove passing tests with `npm run burndown:remove <file>`

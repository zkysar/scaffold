# Feature Specification: Shell Completion for CLI

**Feature Branch**: `002-shell-completion-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "shell completion for this cli"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CLI user, I want to use tab completion in my shell to discover available commands, subcommands, and options without having to remember exact syntax or consult documentation, making the CLI more efficient and user-friendly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has installed the scaffold CLI and enabled shell completion, **When** they type `scaffold ` and press TAB, **Then** they see all available top-level commands (new, template, check, fix, extend, clean)

2. **Given** a user types `scaffold template ` and presses TAB, **When** in a shell with completion enabled, **Then** they see all available template subcommands [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what template subcommands are available - list, add, remove, update?]

3. **Given** a user types `scaffold new --` and presses TAB, **When** completion is enabled, **Then** they see all available flags and options for the new command

4. **Given** a user types `scaffold check ` and presses TAB, **When** in a directory with projects, **Then** they see available project names as completion suggestions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it suggest project names from current directory or from a registry?]

5. **Given** a user types a partial command like `scaffold te` and presses TAB, **When** completion is enabled, **Then** the command auto-completes to `scaffold template`

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shell completion is not supported for the user's shell? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which shells should be supported - bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell?]
- How does system handle completion when no valid options exist?
- What happens if completion script installation fails?
- How are dynamic completions handled (e.g., project names that change over time)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide tab completion for all scaffold CLI commands (new, template, check, fix, extend, clean)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide completion for all command flags and options
- **FR-003**: System MUST support completion in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which shells - bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, all common shells?]
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to install/enable shell completion via a simple command
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide completion for subcommands when applicable
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle partial command/option completion (auto-complete when unique match exists)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide contextual completions where applicable [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it complete project names, template names, file paths?]
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to uninstall/disable shell completion cleanly
- **FR-009**: System MUST gracefully handle cases where completion cannot be provided
- **FR-010**: Completion MUST work for both short (-v) and long (--verbose) option formats where applicable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Completion Script**: Shell-specific script that enables tab completion functionality, installed in user's shell configuration
- **Command Registry**: Collection of all available commands, subcommands, and their options that can be completed
- **Dynamic Completion Provider**: Component that provides context-aware completions (e.g., available project names, template names)

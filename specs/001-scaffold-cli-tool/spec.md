# Feature Specification: Scaffold CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-scaffold-cli-tool`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Generic project structure management with template-based scaffolding"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a software developer, I want to quickly create new projects with standardized structures and maintain consistency across projects by using reusable templates, so that I can focus on writing code rather than setting up project organization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to start a new web project, **When** they run `scaffold new my-project`, **Then** they are prompted to select from available templates and a structured project directory is created
2. **Given** a developer has created a custom folder structure, **When** they run `scaffold template create`, **Then** they can save this structure as a reusable template for future projects
3. **Given** an existing project has deviated from its template, **When** they run `scaffold check`, **Then** they receive a report of structural differences and can run `scaffold sync` to repair the structure
4. **Given** a developer wants to add additional templates to an existing project, **When** they run `scaffold extend`, **Then** the new template structure is merged without conflicts
5. **Given** multiple developers work on the same project type, **When** they use shared templates, **Then** all projects maintain consistent structure and organization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a project already exists at the specified path?
- How does system handle conflicts when multiple templates define the same folder?
- What happens when a template file is corrupted or invalid?
- How does system handle permission issues when creating directories?
- What happens when syncing would delete user-created files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new projects with pre-defined directory structures
- **FR-002**: System MUST support creating, updating, and deleting custom templates
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to validate existing project structures against their templates
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide ability to repair non-compliant project structures with user confirmation
- **FR-005**: System MUST support adding multiple templates to a single project
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to view available templates and their details
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both global (user-wide) and local (project-specific) configurations
- **FR-008**: System MUST track which templates were used to create each project
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide dry-run capability for destructive operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST support backing up files before making structural changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow configuration of strict vs non-strict mode for template compliance
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to clean up temporary files and caches
- **FR-013**: System MUST support template variables for dynamic content generation
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate template definitions before applying them
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to export and share template definitions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: A directory structure created and managed by scaffold, tracks applied templates and configuration
- **Template**: A reusable definition of folder structure, files, and organization rules
- **Manifest**: Project metadata including creation history, applied templates, and version tracking
- **Configuration**: Settings that control scaffold behavior at global, workspace, or project level
- **Template Variable**: Placeholder values that get replaced during project creation (e.g., project name, date)

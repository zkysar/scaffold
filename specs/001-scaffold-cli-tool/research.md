# Research Findings: Scaffold CLI Tool

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Feature**: Scaffold CLI Tool Implementation

## Technology Decisions

### 1. CLI Framework Architecture
**Decision**: Commander.js with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Most widely adopted Node.js CLI framework with 25M+ weekly downloads
- Excellent TypeScript support with strong typing
- Built-in help generation and command parsing
- Supports both action-based and git-style subcommands
**Alternatives Considered**:
- yargs: More complex API, overkill for our use case
- oclif: Too opinionated, requires specific project structure
- caporal: Less mature, smaller community

### 2. Template Storage Strategy
**Decision**: JSON-based template definitions with file system storage
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable and editable format
- Native JavaScript/TypeScript support
- Easy versioning with semantic versioning in JSON
- Can be extended to YAML later if needed
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database storage: Unnecessary complexity, requires runtime dependency
- Binary format: Not human-readable, harder to debug
- ZIP archives: Complicates editing and version control

### 3. File System Operations
**Decision**: fs-extra with glob patterns
**Rationale**:
- fs-extra provides promise-based API with extra utilities
- Includes recursive operations (ensureDir, copy, remove)
- glob for pattern matching in template definitions
- Cross-platform path handling built-in
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Native fs module: Requires more boilerplate
- node-fs: Deprecated in favor of fs-extra
- shelljs: Overhead of shell commands, platform differences

### 4. Configuration Management
**Decision**: Cascading JSON configuration with clear precedence
**Rationale**:
- Precedence order: Project > Workspace > Global
- JSON for consistency with templates
- Simple merge strategy for cascading configs
- Easy to debug and inspect
**Alternatives Considered**:
- INI files: Limited data structure support
- Environment variables: Not suitable for complex configurations
- TOML: Less familiar to JavaScript developers

### 5. Interactive Prompts
**Decision**: inquirer with chalk for terminal colors
**Rationale**:
- inquirer is the de facto standard for Node.js CLIs
- Supports various prompt types (list, checkbox, confirm)
- chalk for consistent color coding across platforms
- Both have excellent TypeScript definitions
**Alternatives Considered**:
- prompts: Smaller but less feature-rich
- enquirer: Similar to inquirer but less mature TypeScript support
- readline: Too low-level for complex interactions

## Best Practices Identified

### TypeScript CLI Architecture
1. **Command Pattern**: Each command as a separate class/module
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from CLI interface
3. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract file system operations
4. **Factory Pattern**: For creating templates and projects
5. **Observer Pattern**: For progress reporting during operations

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **User-Friendly Messages**: Wrap technical errors with actionable messages
2. **Exit Codes**: Consistent non-zero exit codes for different error types
3. **Verbose Mode**: Detailed stack traces only when requested
4. **Recovery Suggestions**: Provide next steps for common errors

### Testing Approach (Containerized)
1. **Test Environment**: All tests run in Docker containers for consistency
2. **Unit Tests**: Mock file system with mock-fs in containerized environment
3. **Integration Tests**: Use container volumes for isolated file operations
4. **E2E Tests**: Spawn CLI process within container and verify outputs
5. **Snapshot Testing**: For command outputs and generated files
6. **Container Strategy**:
   - Development container with hot-reload and debugging
   - Test container with isolated test environment
   - CI/CD container for automated testing
   - Production container with minimal footprint

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Import heavy dependencies only when needed
2. **Parallel Operations**: Use Promise.all for independent file operations
3. **Caching**: Cache template definitions in memory during session
4. **Incremental Updates**: Only sync changed files, not entire structure

## Conflict Resolution Patterns

### Template Merge Conflicts
**Strategy**: Priority-based resolution with user prompts
1. Check for conflicts before applying templates
2. Present conflicts to user with options:
   - Keep existing
   - Replace with template
   - Merge (if applicable)
   - Skip file
3. Remember choices for batch operations

### File System Conflicts
**Strategy**: Safe operations with rollback capability
1. Check permissions before operations
2. Create backups in .scaffold/tmp before destructive operations
3. Atomic operations where possible
4. Rollback on partial failure

## Security Considerations

1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validate all paths stay within project root
2. **Template Validation**: Schema validation before applying templates
3. **Safe Defaults**: Non-destructive operations by default
4. **Permission Checks**: Verify write permissions before operations
5. **No Code Execution**: Templates are data-only, no executable code

## Platform Compatibility

### Cross-Platform Considerations
1. Use path.join() for all path operations
2. Handle both forward and backslashes in user input
3. Case-sensitivity awareness for file systems
4. Line ending normalization (CRLF vs LF)
5. Unicode file name support

## Containerization Strategy

### Development Environment
**Decision**: Docker Compose for orchestrated development
**Rationale**:
- Consistent development environment across all developers
- Isolated dependencies prevent version conflicts
- Easy onboarding with single `docker-compose up` command
- Hot-reload support for rapid development
**Implementation**:
- Node.js 20-alpine base image for minimal size
- Volume mounts for source code with hot-reload
- Separate containers for development, testing, and debugging
- Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration

### Testing Infrastructure
**Decision**: Containerized test execution from start
**Rationale**:
- Reproducible test environments
- Parallel test execution in isolated containers
- No local Node.js installation required
- CI/CD ready from day one
**Implementation**:
- Test container with all dependencies pre-installed
- Volume mounts for test artifacts and coverage reports
- Network isolation for integration tests
- Container-based test fixtures for file system operations

## Next Steps for Phase 1
1. Set up Docker and Docker Compose configuration
2. Define TypeScript interfaces for all entities
3. Create service contracts for each command
4. Design state machines for template operations
5. Establish containerized testing patterns with examples
6. Set up containerized build and distribution pipeline

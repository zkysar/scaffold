# Implementation Plan: Scaffold CLI Tool

**Branch**: `001-scaffold-cli-tool` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-scaffold-cli-tool/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Building a CLI tool for generic project structure management that allows developers to create, validate, and maintain standardized project structures using reusable templates. The tool will support template management, project creation with multiple templates, structure validation, and automated structure repair.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript 5.3+
**Primary Dependencies**: commander (CLI framework), inquirer (interactive prompts), fs-extra (file operations), chalk (terminal colors)
**Storage**: JSON files for templates and manifests, local filesystem for configurations
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support, mock-fs for file system testing, containerized test environment
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI via npm/npx (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single (CLI tool)
**Development Environment**: Docker-based containerized development and testing from start
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response for all operations, instant template application
**Constraints**: <50MB package size including dependencies, Node.js runtime required
**Scale/Scope**: Support 100+ templates, projects with 1000+ files/directories

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since the constitution file is a template and not filled in, I'll proceed with general best practices:
- [ ] Keep it simple - single responsibility per component
- [ ] Test-first development approach
- [ ] Clear interfaces and contracts
- [ ] Minimal external dependencies
- [ ] Observable through structured logging

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Node.js CLI tool with TypeScript

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Best practices for TypeScript CLI architecture with commander
   - Template storage and versioning strategies in Node.js
   - File system conflict resolution patterns using fs-extra
   - Configuration precedence handling with JSON files
   - Interactive prompt patterns with inquirer

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations - proceeding with simple, single-project Node.js/TypeScript CLI structure.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
